# E06b-Tiles
Hello!

In this exercise, I designed my own platforming map.  My map requires the player to jump over two gaps, climb a hill, and jump onto a raised platform.

In order to make this map, I downloaded Tilex and created the map using two layers: platforms and coins.  Anything that I put down on the coin layer could be collected and would contribute to the score.  The only things I layed down on this layers were the jewels.

Thanks for reading!
